        <p class="card-text">
          The examination pattern of the institute is designed in such a way that the student comes out with the best capability in him. During a particular session, students are counter-checked by enabling them to appear for 3 mid-session tests (MST). Each MST comprises 30 marks. These MSTs at different intervals prepare the students to cover the whole syllabus and come with flying colors in the final examination.
