                                            I am Rishab Sharma. I always had a keen liking towards studying in a hilly
                                            area, which is one of the reasons why I chose this college. The college was
                                            highly recommended to me by one of my close relatives. I gained practical
                                            knowledge and found the staff to be very cooperative and hardworking. The
                                            atmosphere was calming and pleasant. In addition to theoretical and
                                            practical knowledge, I actively participated in extracurricular activities,
                                            such as being the captain of the bhangra team, which performed at the state
                                            level.
                                            After completing my diploma, I secured a position at Mahindra and Mahindra,
                                            Mohali, as a Diploma Engineering Trainee during the placement drive. This
                                            achievement was a result of my hard work and the support from my beloved
                                            teachers. During my years at the college, I developed mentally for the real
                                            world and acquired all the necessary knowledge to become a part of the
                                            automobile industry. This college will undoubtedly bring out a better
                                            version of you.

                                            My name is Nitish Kumar belongs to Talwara. I was quite unclear about my
                                            career. At that time, I got admission in SASS GPC Talwara. I was nervous to
                                            go there however, it came out to a great place with incredible professors
                                            and collegiate. The teaching skills over here are amazing, the skill set and
                                            knowledge of the professors, I really admire. Alongside the study, I took
                                            part in co-curricular activities, I was in Bhangra Team, Participated in
                                            Poem Recitation, Buddy activities, many other things. The experience of 3
                                            years made realize and make me understand various things which further
                                            helped in my personal as well as professional life such as dealing with
                                            different kind on people. Right now, I am working in a US based MNC due to
                                            the practical skills I have Gained during my time in college. At the end I
                                            crave to say (Practical + Theoretical + Ethical) work done by the collage is
                                            not only for us but for the Society.

                                            Polytechnic College, Talwara in 2018 batch. The teachers over there have a
                                            positive vibe which make us believe in them and there way of study, which
                                            eventually leads to great results. While studying here, everyone encouraged
                                            me to take part in activities which usually took place at the college such

                                            I have passed senior secondary school from Riyali and after that I did
                                            diploma from S. Amarjit Singh Sahi Government Polytechnic College, Talwara
                                            from 2017 - 2020 and I got to learn a lot of practical skill in this college
                                            and theoretically and atmosphere in the college was very nice staff and very
                                            special. Their method of teaching was very good, and bonding was very good,
                                            after passing out. As soon as my studies were completed, I sat in a
                                            placement dive organized in college and was placed in Ganesh Kartikey
                                            construction Pvt ltd Company, Amritsar. All the knowledge I gained during
                                            those years yielded a fruitful result.<br />

                                            I belong to economically backward area called Kandi. I was quite unclear
                                            about my professional life before joining S. Amarjit Singh Sahi Govt.
                                            Polytechnic College Talwara. My 3 year experience is more exciting and made
                                            me more passionate about my professional learning. The teaching is very
                                            good. The teachers make sure the concepts are well explained and give proper
                                            guidance to anyone who is facing any trouble.<br /><br />
